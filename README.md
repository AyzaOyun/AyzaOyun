ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!  
My name is Aiza Oiun.
With 7 years of experience in the civil service, I worked on the analysis of regional economic sectors (tourism, entrepreneurship, foreign economic activity), project management, and business acceleration. Since October 2024, I have been working as a data analyst in the alcohol industry, focusing on developing and automating reports, maintaining internal databases, and delivering ad-hoc analytics.

To strengthen my data skills, I studied SQL on Udemy and completed data analysis courses at Yandex Workshop. Iâ€™m also pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree at ITMO University, majoring in Infocommunication Technologies and Communication Systems â€” the Cloud DevOps Engineer track.

Key skills: Python, SQL, Tableau, MS Excel, A/B testing, statistics, business metrics analysis.
